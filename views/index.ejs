								<p>The WiCS Industry Mentorship Program pairs current USF undergrad and grad students with industry role models. Mentors and mentees should plan to be in touch approximately once a month with additional visits decided mutually by each pair. Mentors will provide advice on various topics (e.g. how to successfully pursue a Computer Science degree, how to join research groups, how to prepare for a technical career, how to obtain a job) and serve as someone to chat with about the field. WiCS will also hold mixers to provide networking opportunites between all mentors and mentees.</p>
